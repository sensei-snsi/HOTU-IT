## our team

The team name is HOTU IT. WE chose this name because Tomponsky district is located in the northern part of our vast Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) ;). Manager - Burtseva Naryyana, Designers - Semyonova Aitalina, Popova Karina, Apollonov Maxim, developer - Gabyshev David

## Who is it for?

Paytax was developed for the population of Yakutsk and the Federal Tax Service. For example, the client could not make a purchase due to the fact that the seller did not have a cash register, he was asked to transfer money using a “mobile bank”. Then the client using the platform can leave the seller's geodata with a comment. After the data is transferred to responsible persons and accepted for work,
the client is notified about this.

## How does it work? (Technology stack)

Our application has a simple registration. For example, a client buys products in a non-cash (mobile) way, after that he uses the application to leave the seller's geodata with a comment. After the data is transferred to the responsible persons and accepted for work, the client is notified about this. The more such comments,
the less the entrepreneur's reputation becomes. To do this, we use programs such as Figma, Canvas, Procreate (design), JavaScript, Python, CSS, HTML, VS Code (development)
